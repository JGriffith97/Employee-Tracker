## Description

This is an employee tracker, designed to track individual employees, their roles, departments, and salary. This application was made with NodeJS, mySQL, and with the console.table, dotenv, inquirer, and mysql2 NPM modules. As part of the Module 12 Challenge of the UofU's Coding Bootcamp.

---

## Installation

This application runs via NodeJS purely within the command line and will require NPM. Please refer to: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ & https://www.npmjs.com/

---

## Usage

Assuming NodeJS and NPM are installed, from the command line, in the root directory, type 'npm i' to install the necessary modules in the root directory. Enter your credentials in the '.env.EXAMPLE' file, and rename it to '.env'. From mySQL, SOURCE './db/schema.sql' and 'seeds.sql' in the same directory for placeholder content. Initialize the application by typing 'npm start' in the command line (not mySQL!), then utilize the inquirer prompts to navigate the app, show, and edit relevant data.
